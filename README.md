# Portfolio

My self-designed portfolio - my story, skills, projects, and contacts are all right here. Thanks to the smooth animations implemented with GSAP, and eye-pleasing color palette, I wish you to enjoy visiting my portfolio.

## Features

- **Design** 

I spent the most time considering the structure, and color palettes. I'm glad to have chosen the dark bg and more soothing colors for text, and on-page elements.

- **Animations** 

This projects improved my understanding of GSAP, and its features.

- **Responsiveness** 

I tried to keep the portfolio's interface as good as possible on all devices. Though, I had to tinker with the Skills section a bit, I believe that the website turned out quite well.

- **Form submission**

As for now, I used formsubmit.co to handle form submissions without having to write my own back-end, and deploy it. In the future, I'm planning to fix this, and add more functionality to the page.
